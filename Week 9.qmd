# Temperature and policy making

## Summary

A critical issue in urban development is that of Urban Heat Islands (UHIs) and the interplay between urban temperature dynamics and public policy. UHIs result in higher urban temperatures compared to surrounding areas, posing significant challenges to urban living and environmental sustainability.

A quick example of an Urban Heat Island is New York City, a heavily built-up area with much higher temperatures to its surrounding rural areas. According to the United State's Environmental Protection Agency, NYC's annual temperature is up to 3 Celsius degrees warmer than it's surrounding areas.

## Urban Heat Island Effect

Urban areas experience elevated temperatures due to factors such as heat-retaining surfaces (concrete and paved roads), industrial activities, scarce green spaces, and pollutants. This phenomenon exacerbates heat waves, impacts human health, and increases energy demand for cooling. This becomes into a vicious never-ending cycle.

This urban heating has drastic consequences over humans and natural environments:
- Heat waves are the deadliest urban phenomenon in urban cities.
- The increase in urban heat has direct implications over the general heat of surrounding natural hubs, which start to degrade.

This is becoming not only a dangerous phenomenon but also expensive, as cities are investing more and more on greener energies, in more green areas, in changing economic and social behaviors, and in general being more heat and energy efficient.

## **Policies**

To combat UHIs effectively, policies must encompass a broad spectrum of urban planning and design strategies. This involves the integration of green infrastructure, such as parks, green roofs, and urban forests, which can provide shade and reduce surface temperatures through evapotranspiration. Reflective materials for buildings and pavements can deflect sunlight and decrease heat absorption. Enhancing urban ventilation can also play a significant role in reducing UHIs, facilitating the natural cooling of urban areas.

Additionally, policies should encourage the use of sustainable transportation options to reduce heat-generating traffic congestion. The development of compact, mixed-use communities can decrease the need for vehicular travel, thus reducing the heat emitted by vehicles. Urban planning policies that prioritize pedestrian-friendly and shaded pathways encourage walking and biking, further reducing the urban heat footprint.

Addressing UHIs requires comprehensive policy strategies, including the promotion of green infrastructure, reflective building materials, and enhanced urban planning to increase ventilation and shade. These measures can mitigate the effects of UHIs, improving urban resilience and sustainability.

### **Policy at a Global level**

At the global level, initiatives like the New Urban Agenda, Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and resources such as the Beat The Heat Handbook offer frameworks and guidelines for tackling UHIs through sustainable urban development practices.

New Urban Agenda: Adopted at the United Nations Conference on Housing and Sustainable Urban Development (Habitat III) in 2016, the New Urban Agenda provides a roadmap for building cities that can accommodate future growth in a sustainable, resilient, and inclusive way. It emphasizes the need for green public spaces, sustainable mobility, and environmentally sustainable and resilient urban development.

Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): Specifically, SDG 11 focuses on making cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable. Addressing UHIs fits within this goal by promoting sustainable urban design and infrastructure that contribute to cooler urban environments. Implementing UHI mitigation strategies aligns with achieving several targets under SDG 11.

### **Local Policy - Medellin's Corredor Verde**

Medellín's approach to combating urban heat and improving environmental quality through its innovative Green Corridors project offers a compelling model for cities worldwide grappling with the challenges of urbanization and climate change. Here's a breakdown of the project's aspects:

**Problem:** Rising temperatures and poor air quality, exacerbated by the urban heat island effect and significant increases in private transport, have become pressing issues for Medellín. The city's geographical position in the Aburrá Valley further complicates these challenges by trapping pollution within its boundaries, with conditions unfavorable for the dispersion of pollutants.

**Proposal:** In response, the city initiated the Green Corridors project in 2016, aiming to mitigate heat and improve air quality through the extensive planting of over 30 corridors with 120,000 plants and 12,500 trees initially, expanding to 2.5 million smaller plants and 880,000 trees by 2021. This initiative sought to transform urban spaces by integrating greenery into road verges, vertical gardens, and along waterways, effectively connecting the city's green spaces.

**Methodology:** The project was strategically planned and implemented to enhance green coverage in areas lacking it, with a focus on major roads and waterways. An investment of $16.3 million was initially made, with ongoing maintenance costs. The selection of plant species, including highly pollution-absorbent ones like the mango tree (Mangifera indica), was critical to the project's goals of cooling the city and improving air quality.

**Results:** The implementation of green corridors has led to a noticeable 2°C reduction in temperature across the city, alongside potential improvements in air quality and biodiversity. Early studies and observations suggest the project has been effective in absorbing pollutants and reducing CO2 emissions, though comprehensive data on pollution reduction is still forthcoming.

**Conclusions:** Medellín's Green Corridors project exemplifies how nature-based solutions can address urban environmental challenges, offering a replicable model for other cities. Its success highlights the importance of community support, innovative planning, and the integration of green spaces in urban design to create climate-resilient and sustainable cities. The project's popularity and effectiveness have inspired other Colombian cities and regions like São Paulo to adopt similar initiatives, underlining the potential of green corridors as a global urban strategy against the impacts of climate change.

## Remote Sensing

Remote sensing technologies, particularly satellite imagery, play a crucial role in addressing urban heat island (UHI) effects, a phenomenon where urban regions experience significantly higher temperatures than their rural counterparts due to human activities and the prevalence of surfaces that absorb and retain heat. Satellites like Landsat and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) are at the forefront of monitoring these temperature disparities, offering critical insights into urban climate dynamics.

Landsat satellites, with their detailed spatial resolution, provide comprehensive data on land cover and land use changes over time, enabling the identification of areas contributing most significantly to UHI effects. This capability is essential for urban planners and environmental scientists looking to pinpoint specific urban sectors that may require green infrastructure interventions, such as increased vegetation or reflective materials, to mitigate heat absorption.

MODIS, on the other hand, stands out due to its high temporal resolution, capturing 1-2 images daily for almost any location on the globe. This frequent data collection is invaluable for tracking temperature variations over short intervals, allowing for near-real-time monitoring of UHI effects and the effectiveness of mitigation strategies implemented to combat them. The ability of MODIS to provide daily temperature data supports efforts to understand how urban heat fluctuates with changing weather patterns, urban development, and seasonal changes, providing a dynamic view of the urban climate.

Together, the detailed land cover data from Landsat and the high-frequency temperature data from MODIS offer a comprehensive toolkit for detecting, understanding, and monitoring UHI effects. These insights enable targeted interventions, such as the strategic placement of green spaces or the implementation of cool roofs, to reduce urban temperatures and improve the livability of cities facing the challenges of climate change and urbanization.

## Class practical 

**Methodology:**
To assess the land surface temperatures (LST) in Los Angeles, we utilized the Google Earth Engine platform and processed Landsat 8 Collection 2 Level 2 data. The Landsat images were filtered for a summer period from June to August 2022, focusing on days with less than 10% cloud cover to ensure clear-sky conditions. A custom script was applied to convert the raw thermal band (ST_B10) data into Celsius using the appropriate scale factors (0.00341802 and -273.15 for conversion to Celsius). We then masked out non-physical temperature values (less than 0 Celsius) and calculated the mean temperature across the filtered image collection to generate a single temperature map. This mean temperature map was clipped to the geographic boundaries of Los Angeles, defined by a specified set of coordinates, and visualized using a color palette ranging from cool (blue) to warm (red) temperatures.

The MODIS data from both the Aqua and Terra satellites were processed to provide a comprehensive analysis of the land surface temperatures over Los Angeles. After loading the respective image collections, we applied a scale factor of 0.02 and converted the LST from Kelvin to Celsius. Subsequently, the datasets from both satellites were merged to calculate the mean temperature, ensuring a robust dataset by combining morning and afternoon observations. The resulting mean temperature data was clipped to the Los Angeles region and visualized on the map with a color gradient representing the temperature range. Additionally, a time series chart was generated to illustrate the LST variation over the selected summer period.

**Interpretations:**
The resulting temperature map of Los Angeles reveals spatial variations in land surface temperatures during the summer period. Warmer temperatures, depicted in red, are prominent in urbanized and densely built-up areas, suggesting an urban heat island effect where human-made surfaces absorb and re-radiate heat more than natural landscapes. Cooler areas, shown in blue, typically correspond to vegetated regions, water bodies, and higher elevations that are known to influence local climate conditions. The minimum and maximum temperatures extracted from the data indicate a range of observed temperatures and help in identifying the extent of temperature variation across different land cover types. These insights can inform urban planning initiatives aimed at mitigating heat-related risks and enhancing the city's climate resilience.

The MODIS LST map reveals the thermal landscape of Los Angeles, with urban areas distinctly warmer due to the urban heat island effect, as well as cooler regions corresponding to vegetated and coastal areas. The time series chart showcases the daily temperature fluctuations, providing insight into the dynamic nature of urban temperatures. These temperature patterns are crucial for urban planners and public health officials as they implement strategies to mitigate extreme heat and enhance urban livability. The ability to visualize and analyze temperature variations over time is a powerful tool in understanding and responding to the impacts of climate variability and urbanization.
