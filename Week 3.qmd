# Week 3 - Geometric and Atmospheric Correction

## **What is it?**

-   Satellite images are assigned a coordinate reference system (CRS) in GIS.

-   Image distortions can result from factors like off-nadir view angles, topography, wind (in aerial data collection), and Earth's rotation.

-   Geometric correction aims to rectify these distortions for accurate spatial analysis.

-   Ground Control Points (GPS) are used to match known points in the image with a reference dataset or map.

-   Coordinates from GPS points are used to model geometric transformation coefficients.

-   Various transformation algorithms are available for modeling the actual coordinates.

-   The correction process involves both forward and backward mapping to ensure alignment.

-   Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) is used to assess the accuracy of the correction.

-   Lower RMSE values indicate a better fit of corrected data.

-   Resampling methods like Nearest Neighbor, Linear, Cubic, and Cubic spline may be applied.

-   Environmental factors, including atmospheric scattering and topographic attenuation, can affect remote sensing data.

-   Atmospheric correction is essential when precise reflectance values are required for analysis.

-   It involves normalizing intensities of different bands within an image or across multiple dates.

-   Methods for atmospheric correction include relative, pseudo-invariant features (PIFs), and absolute correction.

-   Absolute correction requires atmospheric measurements and radiative transfer models.

-   Tools like ACORN, FLAASH, QUAC, and ATCOR are available for atmospheric correction.

-   Radiometric calibration converts digital brightness values (DN) to scaled surface reflectance.

-   Landsat data is often distributed as a surface reflectance product.

-   Atmospheric correction aims to remove the effects of atmospheric scattering and absorption.

-   The corrected data provides more accurate information for analysis and interpretation.

## **Practical Application and Use:**

-   These correction techniques are crucial for obtaining accurate and reliable data in remote sensing.

-   They ensure that imagery can be effectively utilized for various applications.

-   Corrected data is essential for tasks like land cover classification and change detection.

-   It enables the extraction of valuable information from remote sensing imagery.

-   Practical applications include agriculture, urban planning, environmental monitoring, and disaster management.

-   Atmospheric correction is particularly important for tasks involving precise reflectance values.

-   It supports the assessment of biophysical parameters like temperature, leaf area index, and NDVI.

-   Corrected data enhances the quality and usefulness of remote sensing products.

-   They are integral in providing decision-makers with valuable insights for informed choices.

## **Personal Reflection:**
