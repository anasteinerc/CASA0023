# Week 3 - Geometric and Atmospheric Correction

## **What is it?**

Satellite images are crucial sources of geospatial information, but they are not immune to distortions that can impact the accuracy of spatial analysis. These distortions may arise from various factors, including off-nadir view angles, variations in topography, wind effects (particularly in aerial data collection), and even the Earth's rotation. To address these distortions and ensure the precise alignment of satellite imagery with geographic data, a process known as geometric correction is employed. Geometric correction plays a pivotal role in rectifying these distortions, making it an indispensable step in the preparation of satellite imagery for accurate spatial analysis.

Geometric correction is a meticulous process that involves several key steps. Ground Control Points (GCPs), often established through Global Positioning System (GPS) measurements, serve as reference markers. These GCPs are used to establish a mathematical model for geometric transformation, enabling the adjustment of the image's coordinates. Various transformation algorithms are available to model the actual coordinates accurately. The correction process encompasses both forward and backward mapping to ensure precise alignment. Additionally, the accuracy of the geometric correction is assessed using metrics such as Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). Lower RMSE values indicate a better fit of the corrected data to the reference dataset. Overall, geometric correction is fundamental in enhancing the accuracy and usability of satellite imagery for a wide range of applications, from environmental monitoring to urban planning.

## **Practical Application and Use:**

Correction techniques play a pivotal role in the realm of remote sensing, underpinning the foundation of accurate and reliable data acquisition. Their importance cannot be overstated, as they serve as the linchpin for ensuring that remotely sensed imagery can be effectively harnessed across a multitude of applications. The process of correction not only rectifies distortions but also paves the way for the extraction of valuable information from remote sensing data. This corrected data is indispensable for critical tasks such as land cover classification, change detection, and the assessment of biophysical parameters like temperature, leaf area index, and NDVI. These correction techniques find practical applications in diverse fields, including agriculture, urban planning, environmental monitoring, and disaster management. Ultimately, they elevate the quality and utility of remote sensing products, equipping decision-makers with invaluable insights for making informed choices and driving evidence-based decisions.

## **Personal Reflection:**

In the world of remote sensing, understanding and using geometric and atmospheric correction techniques is a big deal, it is one of the most important things. These techniques make sure that the pictures and data we get from satellites will really show what's happening on Earth. As technology keeps getting better, we've got more robust tools and tricks that make these corrections even more precise and easier to make.

As an anthropologist, working in environmental conservation and rural development, and now diving into data science, I am getting very inspired by all of this new information regarding remote sensing. Remote sensing will let me gather lots of info about our planet and using these correction techniques, it will be easier to make smart decisions for the environment and how rural areas develop.
