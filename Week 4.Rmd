Week 4 - Public Policy Recommendations

Case study: Bogota's Green Corridor Plan

-   Summary of city and PP:

Bogota is a city heavily criticized for its poor urban planning; it is one of the largest and densest capital cities in Latin America yet it suffers from having some of the worst public transportation systems and a lack of sustainable infrastructure **(cita).**

For many decades, Bogota was one of the most advanced and innovative cities, home to Transmilenio (xx) and at the time, the largest bicycle route in South America (xx), as well as having constructed various sustainable buildings (xx). Nonetheless, the city has grown at such a fast rate, and in such an informal way, that the urban planning has not been able to support the growing demographic necessities. **(cita).**

Because of this, it's inhabitants are exposed to heavily contaminated air, to horrible traffic, to an expensive transportation system that does not support the population density of the city, and to great disparities regarding access to sustainable infrastructure such as as green housing, bicycle routs, etc... **(cita).** It is one of few cities with more than 7 million citizens that does NOT have a metro system. **(cita).**

Bogotá has implemented a Green Corridors project to create pedestrian-friendly, environmentally sustainable areas throughout the city. This involves the development of green spaces, the improvement of sidewalks and bike lanes, and the reduction of car lanes in certain areas to encourage non-motorized transportation.

"Bogotá's Green Corridors" refers to a public policy initiative aimed at creating pedestrian-friendly, environmentally sustainable areas throughout the city of Bogotá, Colombia. These Green Corridors are designed to promote sustainable urban development, improve air quality, enhance the quality of life for residents, and encourage alternative modes of transportation.

While I do not have access to real-time data or updates beyond my last knowledge update, I can provide you with a general overview of the policy's key components and objectives:

**Objectives**:

-   To transform certain streets and corridors into pedestrian-friendly spaces with an emphasis on greenery, parks, and public spaces.

-   To reduce car lanes and allocate more space for pedestrians, cyclists, and public transportation.

-   To encourage the use of non-motorized transportation, such as walking and cycling.

-   To combat air pollution and enhance urban sustainability by increasing green spaces and reducing car emissions.

**Key Components**:

-   **Urban Planning**: The initiative involves urban planning and redesign efforts to allocate more space for pedestrians, greenery, and public amenities.

-   **Cycling Infrastructure**: The creation of dedicated bike lanes and cycling infrastructure to promote sustainable transportation options.

-   **Public Transportation Integration**: Integration with public transportation systems, such as TransMilenio, to encourage the use of buses and reduce private car use.

-   **Green Spaces**: The inclusion of green spaces, parks, and urban gardens along the corridors to enhance the urban environment and improve air quality.

-   **Accessibility**: Improving accessibility for people with disabilities through the creation of barrier-free spaces.

-   **Street Furniture**: Installation of street furniture, benches, and public art to enhance the overall experience of the corridors.

Since public policies can evolve and change over time, it is advisable to consult official government sources or the website of the Mayor's Office of Bogotá for the most up-to-date information on the status and details of the "Bogotá's Green Corridors" policy, including any recent developments, projects, or changes that may have occurred since my last knowledge update.
