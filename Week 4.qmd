# Week 4 - Public Policy Case Study

## Bogota's Green Corridor Plan - Septima Verde

### Context of Bogota

Bogota is a city heavily criticized for its poor urban planning; it is one of the largest and densest capital cities in Latin America yet it suffers from having some of the worst public transportation systems and a lack of sustainable infrastructure **(cita).**

For many decades, Bogota was one of the most advanced and innovative cities, home to Transmilenio (xx) and at the time, the largest bicycle route in South America (xx), as well as having constructed various sustainable buildings (xx). Nonetheless, the city has grown at such a fast rate, and in such an informal way, that the urban planning has not been able to support the growing demographic necessities. **(cita).**

Because of this, it's inhabitants are exposed to heavily contaminated air, to horrible traffic, to an expensive transportation system that does not support the population density of the city, and to great disparities regarding access to sustainable infrastructure such as as green housing, bicycle routs, etc... **(cita).** It is one of few cities with more than 7 million citizens that does NOT have a metro system. **(cita)**, making it very dependent on cars. There have been many proposals for urban "retenes" and carpooling obligations, which have all been debated and blocked by congress.

### Septima Verde

One of the newest project ideas is the Septima Verde Project, which proposes to build a green corridor along one of the largest and busiest avenues in the city; this project includes building pedestrian and cycle friendly routes and the delimitation of green spaces and parks, ultimately reducing car lanes and hopefully encouraging for more non-motorized transportation. The project's goal is also to promote more sustainable urban development plans and improve air quality.

This project will use the current sidewalk and 4 vehicule lanes (half of the highway) as well as various unused lots and dwellings.

Objectives:

1.  To transform certain streets and corridors into pedestrian-friendly spaces with an emphasis on greenery, parks, and public spaces.

2.  To reduce car lanes and allocate more space for pedestrians, cyclists, and public transportation.

3.  To encourage the use of non-motorized transportation, such as walking and cycling.

4.  To combat air pollution and enhance urban sustainability by increasing green spaces and reducing car emissions.

Key Components:

1.  Urban Planning: The initiative involves urban planning and redesign efforts to allocate more space for pedestrians, greenery, and public amenities.

2.  Cycling Infrastructure: The creation of dedicated bike lanes and cycling infrastructure to promote sustainable transportation options.

3.  Public Transportation Integration: Integration with public transportation systems, such as TransMilenio, to encourage the use of buses and reduce private car use.

4.  Green Spaces: The inclusion of green spaces, parks, and urban gardens along the corridors to enhance the urban environment and improve air quality.

5.  Accessibility: Improving accessibility for people with disabilities through the creation of barrier-free spaces.

6.  Street Furniture: Installation of street furniture, benches, and public art to enhance the overall experience of the corridors.

Within the project, it is also contemplated to construct new routs for Transmilenio (Bogota's bus system) around this corridor, giving people more incentives to not use their car. This last component of the project has generated much public and political debate. The Mayoress of Bogota had made a big point, during her campaign, to not building public transportation infrastructure during this avenue, and this project would be a direct contradiction to this, the main opposers of the project are ironically her election base.

This makes for a very interesting political setting. The creation of the green corridor, as well as the public transportation routes, would really help some of the most deprived populations, as it would give them access to better transportation, to more green areas, and in general would hopefully decongest the traffic; but it has been made clear that it would affect negatively the richer citizens who have benefited from this highway with no public transportation and just private cars. This project has become a clear example of how difficult it is to propose and implement a public policy or a public project that keeps everyone content. Additionally, many opposers also suggest better ways to use the unused lots such as building schools or community centers.

Additionally, this is a hefty project budgeted at 2.5 billion COP (aprox 640 million USD).

### Applications of remote sensing:

I. During the planning and design of this project:

\- Land Use Data (Sentinel-2, Landsat 8): To identify existing use patterns, distinguishing between green spaces, industrial infrastructure, housing, roads, etc. This was critical in defining the green area baseline to which to aggregate too, as well as define the businesses and residential neighborhoods that would be affected.

\- Air Quality Data (Sentinel-5p): To monitor the baseline of air pollution in the designated areas to define the benchmarks.

\- Vegetation and Land Cover Monitoring (Sentinel-2, Landsat 8): To characterize the current vegetation health status and biodiversity, and to better define what type of green areas to add.

II\. During the monitoring and compliance of the project:

\- Urban Heat Monitoring (Thermal imagery): To measure the cooling impact of the green spaces and possible reduced traffic.

\- Air Quality Assessment (Sentinel-5p): To measure improvements in air quality.

\- Traffic Analysis (Satellite traffic data): To identify changes in flows and mobility patterns, to measure traffic of pedestrian and of vehicle paths, to identify consequences over traffic in surrounding highways.

All of this will be complimented with robust demographic and socio economic data, to measure improvements over economy, income and mobility in the affected populations and sectors; as well as with data from traffic police or public transportation companies regarding the hopeful increase in people using public transportation and a reduction in car use.

### Personal reflections:

As a Bogot√°-raised anthropologist and geographer deeply passionate about my city's sustainable development, I have always been very analytical and critical of it's public policy projects and implementations. Witnessing the city's progress towards sustainability with initiatives like "Septima Verde" makes very proud, but it also generates many frustrations as it exhacerbates how politically and economically divided it is.

The high amount of corruption and inefficiency that has haunted local governments often overshadows all sustainable proposals. It really hurts and bothers me to see so much inefficiency due to this. My role as an anthropologist and geographer has fueled my determination to contribute positively to the city's development guaranteeing environmental and social well being.
