Week 4 - Public Policy Recommendations

Case study: Bogota's Green Corridor Plan

-   Summary of city and PP:

Bogota is a city heavily criticized for its poor urban planning; it is one of the largest and densest capital cities in Latin America yet it suffers from having some of the worst public transportation systems and a lack of sustainable infrastructure **(cita).**

For many decades, Bogota was one of the most advanced and innovative cities, home to Transmilenio (xx) and at the time, the largest bicycle route in South America (xx), as well as having constructed various sustainable buildings (xx). Nonetheless, the city has grown at such a fast rate, and in such an informal way, that the urban planning has not been able to support the growing demographic necessities. **(cita).**

Because of this, it's inhabitants are exposed to heavily contaminated air, to horrible traffic, to an expensive transportation system that does not support the population density of the city, and to great disparities regarding access to sustainable infrastructure such as as green housing, bicycle routs, etc... **(cita).** It is one of few cities with more than 7 million citizens that does NOT have a metro system. **(cita)**, making it very dependent on cars. There have been many proposals for urban "retenes" and carpooling obligations, which have all been debated and blocked by congress.

One of the newest project ideas is the Septimva Verde Project, which proposes to build a green corridor along one of the largest and busiest avenues in the city; this project includes building pedestrian and cycle friendly routes and the delimitation of green spaces and parks, ultimately reducing car lanes and hopefully encouraging for more non-motorized transportation. The project's goal is also to promote more sustainable urban development plans and improve air quality. **Mencionar que es un proyecto controversial, que sigue en debate.**

Objectives:

1.  To transform certain streets and corridors into pedestrian-friendly spaces with an emphasis on greenery, parks, and public spaces.

2.  To reduce car lanes and allocate more space for pedestrians, cyclists, and public transportation.

3.  To encourage the use of non-motorized transportation, such as walking and cycling.

4.  To combat air pollution and enhance urban sustainability by increasing green spaces and reducing car emissions.

Key Components:

1.  Urban Planning: The initiative involves urban planning and redesign efforts to allocate more space for pedestrians, greenery, and public amenities.

2.  Cycling Infrastructure: The creation of dedicated bike lanes and cycling infrastructure to promote sustainable transportation options.

3.  Public Transportation Integration: Integration with public transportation systems, such as TransMilenio, to encourage the use of buses and reduce private car use.

4.  Green Spaces: The inclusion of green spaces, parks, and urban gardens along the corridors to enhance the urban environment and improve air quality.

5.  Accessibility: Improving accessibility for people with disabilities through the creation of barrier-free spaces.

6.  Street Furniture: Installation of street furniture, benches, and public art to enhance the overall experience of the corridors.

-   Applications of remote sensing:

1.  Vegetation Monitoring:

    -   Satellite Data: Optical satellite imagery, such as data from the Landsat or Sentinel satellites, can be used. These satellites capture visible and near-infrared wavelengths, which are valuable for assessing vegetation health.

    -   Data Collection: Satellite sensors capture images of Carrera Séptima at regular intervals. The data is collected through passive optical sensors.

    -   Analysis: Remote sensing software can be used to calculate vegetation indices (e.g., Normalized Difference Vegetation Index - NDVI) from satellite imagery. Changes in NDVI over time indicate variations in vegetation cover.

2.  Urban Heat Island Effect:

    -   Satellite Data: Thermal infrared imagery from satellites like Landsat, Sentinel-2, or specialized thermal sensors provides temperature data.

    -   Data Collection: Thermal sensors measure the emitted heat energy from surfaces, including roads and buildings.

    -   Analysis: Thermal data can be used to create temperature maps, identifying areas with elevated temperatures. Comparing pre-project and post-project temperature maps helps assess the cooling effect of green infrastructure.

3.  Air Quality Assessment:

    -   Satellite Data: Satellites equipped with air quality monitoring sensors, such as the Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI), provide data on pollutants like nitrogen dioxide (NO2).

    -   Data Collection: These sensors measure atmospheric composition and pollutant concentrations.

    -   Analysis: Data from air quality sensors can be processed to create pollutant concentration maps. Comparing these maps before and after the project helps assess changes in air quality.

4.  Traffic and Mobility Analysis:

    -   Satellite Data: Traffic monitoring data can be collected through optical and radar sensors on satellites or through specialized traffic monitoring satellites.

    -   Data Collection: These sensors capture images and monitor traffic patterns by tracking vehicle movement.

    -   Analysis: Software can process satellite-derived traffic data to analyze traffic flow, congestion, and changes in mobility along Carrera Séptima.

5.  Pedestrian and Cyclist Counting:

    -   Satellite Data: Remote sensing cameras and sensors deployed along the corridor can capture images and collect data on pedestrian and cyclist movements.

    -   Data Collection: These sensors record the presence and movement of pedestrians and cyclists.

    -   Analysis: The data collected from sensors can be used to count the number of pedestrians and cyclists using Carrera Séptima, helping assess the impact of the project on non-motorized transportation.

6.  Noise Pollution Measurement:

    -   Satellite Data: Noise pollution data can be collected through specialized noise monitoring sensors on satellites.

    -   Data Collection: These sensors measure noise levels in decibels (dB) from space.

    -   Analysis: By comparing noise levels before and after the project, the impact of green infrastructure on noise reduction can be evaluated.

7.  Land Use and Zoning:

    -   Satellite Data: Optical and radar satellite imagery can be used to monitor land use and zoning compliance.

    -   Data Collection: Imagery captures land use changes and construction activities.

    -   Analysis: Remote sensing analysts can identify changes in land use, adherence to zoning regulations, and the conversion of road space into green and public areas.

8.  Infrastructure Maintenance:

    -   Satellite Data: High-resolution optical imagery captures the utilization of public spaces.

    -   Data Collection: Imagery captures the presence and activities of people within public spaces.

    -   Analysis: By analyzing the imagery, remote sensing analysts can measure how public spaces created by the project are being utilized, including pedestrian traffic and gatherings.

-   Personal reflections:

As a Colombian and Bogotá-raised anthropologist and geographer deeply passionate about my city's vibrant culture and potential for sustainable development, my journey has been both inspiring and challenging. Bogotá, with its rich history and diverse communities, has always held a special place in my heart. Witnessing the city's progress towards sustainability has been a source of hope and pride, as initiatives like "Septima Verde" have aimed to transform our urban landscape into a greener, more pedestrian-friendly haven.

However, my passion is tempered by concerns and a critical perspective. The specter of corruption and inefficiency that has haunted local governments often overshadows these noble efforts. It pains me to see the misallocation of resources and missed opportunities for meaningful change. My role as an anthropologist and geographer has fueled my determination to not only celebrate our successes but also hold our leaders accountable for their actions---or lack thereof.

Navigating the delicate balance between love for my city and the need for reform has been a constant theme in my personal and professional life. Despite the challenges, I remain dedicated to contributing to the sustainable development of Bogotá and fostering a brighter future for all its inhabitants, driven by my unwavering belief in the potential of our beautiful city.
