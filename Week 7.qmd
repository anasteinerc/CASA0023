# Classification I

## Summary

This week we learnt about classification techniques in remote sensing, essential for analyzing and monitoring phenomena like urban expansion, air pollution, and changes in land use and cover. These techniques, including machine learning and traditional methods, play a pivotal role in environmental management and urban planning.

We covered a range of supervised machine learning tools – from simple linear regression to CART and Regression Trees. 

### Applications of Classification in Remote Sensing

- **Urban Expansion:** Tracking changes in urban areas using Landsat imagery.
- **Air Pollution:** Monitoring pollution levels through satellite data.
- **Land Use and Land Cover Changes:** Identifying changes over time to inform conservation and development strategies.
- **Forest Dynamics:** Detecting illegal logging and forest degradation.

**Machine Learning:** Both machine learning and traditional classification methods are employed in remote sensing. Machine learning approaches, such as supervised and unsupervised learning, offer powerful tools for handling complex datasets, while traditional methods provide foundational techniques for image classification.

**CART:** CART classifies or predicts outcomes by splitting the dataset into subsets through decision forks based on predictor variables. It aims to minimize variance within subsets for continuous data (via mean square error) and reduce impurity for categorical data (via Gini impurity). The process stops when it meets a predefined criterion to avoid overfitting (where the model fits the training data too closely) or underfitting (where the model is too simplistic).

**Random Forest:** Random Forest improves upon the decision tree method by creating an ensemble of trees, each derived from a subset of the training data. It combines the outcomes of these trees to make a final prediction, enhancing reliability and accuracy by overcoming biases and variances of individual trees.

**Image Classification:** It is the process where images are categorised into one or more classes based on their content. There are two method types for this, supervised (selecting training samples, training the classifier, applying it to classify whole dataset) and unsupervised (Algorithms automatically segment input data into clusters based on inherent patterns/data similarities).

## Application of Random Forest

I found a study, "Estimating mangrove aboveground biomass in the Colombian Pacific coast: A multisensor and machine learning approach," done by John Josephraj Selvaraj and Bryan Ernesto Gallego Pérez, that utilizes a novel approach combining multisensor remote sensing data with machine learning techniques on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform to estimate the aboveground biomass (AGB) of mangroves on Colombia's Pacific coast. 

Employing Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data from ALOS-2/PALSAR-2, SRTM, NASADEM, ALOSDSM, and optical data from Landsat 8 for 2022, the research evaluated various models to quantify mangrove AGB across four departments. The focus on the Random Forest model is significant due to its superior performance in predicting AGB with an R^2 of 0.783, RMSE of 38.239 Mg/ha, and MAE of 27.409 Mg/ha, outperforming other parametric and non-parametric models. This model's effectiveness highlights its ability to manage complex, nonlinear relationships between multisensor remote sensing data and mangrove AGB, providing a highly accurate and reliable method for estimating mangrove biomass.

The study's methodology involved preprocessing of satellite data, model evaluation, and comparison, with a particular emphasis on the Random Forest algorithm for its exceptional accuracy. The generation of an AGB map, indicating mean biomass values across various classes, demonstrates the significant variability in biomass and the model's capability to capture these differences.This approach contributes valuable insights for the management and conservation of mangrove ecosystems, vital for climate change mitigation and the protection of biodiversity and local livelihoods.

## Personal reflection

One of the first things that excites me about this Week's content is being able to connect methodologies from other classes such as regressions and prediction models (Random Forest for example) which I have used for social data science analysis. Learning that these methodologies can also be used for analyzing image data is fascinating and calms be down a bit, knowing that the methodologies are not that much different. That all though this has a robust physics background that I do not have, at the end of the day it is data that I can organize and understand.

The limitation that I find, as with any statistics and data analysis, is the potential bias or manipulation that could happen with a trained model and its supervision. Specifically if this is going to then be used to define public policy or governmental conservation efforts, it is important to limit the bais or at least control for it. 

The second thing that excited me was the application example that I found, not only because it is in Colombia, but specifically in the Pacific region's mangrove which is one the most vulnerable and important ecosystems we have. I have worked with this ecosystem many years, regarding sustainable agriculture and fishing, as well as incorporating it into sustainable tourism. Now, being able to study about it but from a sensor perspective just inspires me to do these types of analysis even more. 

It also reinforced my interest and need to advocate for the conservation of these types of ecosystems, because of the importance they have on food security, global warming reduction, biodiversity, carbon reduction, etc. Being able to monitor it, in such a detailed manner, is extremely important to actually measure its reduction, and be able to mitigate its potential risks.
