# Week 1 - Introduction to Remote Sensing

## **What is it?**

NASA defines remote sensing as "acquiring information from a distance". This information is acquired through sensors mounted on different platforms such as satellites, planes, drones, etc... Currently there are more than 150 satellites and more than 27,000 other devices orbiting the earth.

There are various types of sensors and data sources, as well as applications. Data can come from Sentinel, LANDSAT or SAR satellites, and can be used to monitor various phenomenons such as land covered areas, urban or green space coverage, natural and climate phenomenons, and other atmospheric characteristics.

## Types of sensors

There are two types of sensors:

-   Passive sensors use and detect energy that is available from the sun, but don't emit their own. Examples of this type are the human eye or a camera. They read different types of radiation, each with different wavelengths that operate in different parts of the electromagnetic spectrum. For each type of wavelength and variance under the electromagnetic spectrum, there are different types of sensors.

-   Active sensors have proper sources of illumination and actively emit electromagnetic waves. Some examples are X-rays and Lidar sensors. These are appropriate for difficult climatology and atmospheric conditions such as clouds and storms or air pollution, or to see during the night sky.

## Reflection and Resolutions

Natural or unnatural phenomenon, such as clouds or volcanic ash, can interrupt or affect the reflection and dispersion of electromagnetic waves. The earth absorbs some energy, the other is randomly dispersed in the atmosphere. Different sensors (as mentioned above) are used to identify and capture different electromagnetic wave lengths and types.

Independent of the sensor used, 4 resolutions are needed:

-   Spectral: The number of bands recorded (red, green, blue for visible light).

-   Spatial: The size of each pixel (from cm to km depending on the scope of analysis).

-   Temporal: The frequency with given geographical area is monitored.

-   Radiometric: The range of reflectance values that are registered.

## Practical application and use

Remote sensing can be used in various sectors such as agriculture, natural resource management, flora and fauna monitoring, heat and air pollution measurement, monitoring of natural hazards, measurement of urban and industrial growth, etc. All though it's scope is very large, it is very expensive, and not always has the best resolution imaging; it is necessary to compliment with on-site monitoring that generates smaller high resolution images (traffic cameras, security cameras, on-site wildlife monitoring cameras, for example).

All though there are many applications, the ones that were covered in class are:

-   Sentinel Data - It comes from the European Earth observation satellite program, specifically from satellites that capture high-resolution optical and radar imagery. They use various sensors such as MSI for optical imagery and SAR for radar data; the data recollected is mostly used for environmental monitoring, disaster management and agricultural monitoring. Sentinel captures higher resolution data, because it has more spectral bands and revisits site with a higher frequency. The temporal and spatial high resolution make it ideal for wildlife and climate change monitoring.

-   Landsat Data - It comes from the NASA and the United States Geological Survey, specifically from satellites that have been orbiting for more than 50 years. These sensors capture different types of spectral data (visible, infrared and thermal, for example). This data is used for land cover monitoring, land use management and environmental monitoring. Due to its long-term archive, it's data has been very useful for studying environmental and urban developments and evolution. **On next week's diary, I talk in more detail about these types of sensors!**

## Personal reflection

This is the first time that I work with this type of data. To be honest, it is quite an overwhelming process. It is very technical, I have had to review basic physics that I had not used in many years to remember the electromagnetic spectrum, the different types of wave lengths, colors, etc. It has also been a bit difficult to download data that works and then visualizing it on QGis or Rstudio, for me it is a work in progress as I learn how to be more efficient and accurate. Nonetheless, it is fascinating how

It is quite amazing to see how these large satellites, that I have always seen as very scientific and foreign to me, can produce images and data that is super important and useful for my "real world" applications such as conservation monitoring. Coming from Colombia, a country with unreliable and incomplete environmental and demographic data, I feel that these tools can be amazingly useful to have real-time ecological and social monitoring.

I find it fascinating how one single tool can help in so many ways. As a person that is both interested in demographic changes and environmental conservation, remote sensing of a specific region (such as city) can be used to monitor and evaluate both things. I feel very inspired to use these tools to better diagnose the regions that I am interested in, and identify both the environmental and socioeconomic problematic that most affect the people and wildlife, and then have the ability to do measurement and evaluation in real time. I also think, that from a more superficial and communications perspective, this type of videos or images are also much more beautiful and easy to understand.

I am excited to see how the course progresses and all that I can learn and later apply.
