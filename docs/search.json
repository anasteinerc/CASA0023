This information is acquired through sensors mounted on different platforms such as satellites, planes, drones, etc… Currently there are more than 150 satellites and more than 27,000 other devices orbiting the earth.\nThere are various types of sensors and data sources, as well as applications. Data can come from Sentinel, LANDSAT or SAR satellites, and can be used to monitor various phenomenons such as land covered areas, urban or green space coverage, natural and climate phenomenons, and other atmospheric characteristics.\n\n\n\nRemote Sensing\n\n\nRemote Sensing Earth Observation Guide"

    "text": "2.2 Types of sensors\nThere are two types of sensors:\n\nPassive sensors use and detect energy that is available from the sun, but don’t emit their own. Examples of this type are the human eye or a camera. They read different types of radiation, each with different wavelengths that operate in different parts of the electromagnetic spectrum. For each type of wavelength and variance under the electromagnetic spectrum, there are different types of sensors.\nActive sensors have proper sources of illumination and actively emit electromagnetic waves. Some examples are X-rays and Lidar sensors. These are appropriate for difficult climatology and atmospheric conditions such as clouds and storms or air pollution, or to see during the night sky."

The earth absorbs some energy, the other is randomly dispersed in the atmosphere. Different sensors (as mentioned above) are used to identify and capture different electromagnetic wave lengths and types.\nIndependent of the sensor used, 4 resolutions are needed:\n\nSpectral: The number of bands recorded (red, green, blue for visible light).\nSpatial: The size of each pixel (from cm to km depending on the scope of analysis).\nTemporal: The frequency with given geographical area is monitored.\nRadiometric: The range of reflectance values that are registered."

    "text": "2.4 Practical application and use\nRemote sensing can be used in various sectors such as agriculture, natural resource management, flora and fauna monitoring, heat and air pollution measurement, monitoring of natural hazards, measurement of urban and industrial growth, etc. All though it’s scope is very large, it is very expensive, and not always has the best resolution imaging; it is necessary to compliment with on-site monitoring that generates smaller high resolution images (traffic cameras, security cameras, on-site wildlife monitoring cameras, for example).\nAll though there are many applications, the ones that were covered in class are:\n\nSentinel Data - It comes from the European Earth observation satellite program, specifically from satellites that capture high-resolution optical and radar imagery. They use various sensors such as MSI for optical imagery and SAR for radar data; the data recollected is mostly used for environmental monitoring, disaster management and agricultural monitoring. Sentinel captures higher resolution data, because it has more spectral bands and revisits site with a higher frequency. The temporal and spatial high resolution make it ideal for wildlife and climate change monitoring.\nLandsat Data - It comes from the NASA and the United States Geological Survey, specifically from satellites that have been orbiting for more than 50 years. These sensors capture different types of spectral data (visible, infrared and thermal, for example). This data is used for land cover monitoring, land use management and environmental monitoring. Due to its long-term archive, it’s data has been very useful for studying environmental and urban developments and evolution. On next week’s diary, I talk in more detail about these types of sensors!"

It is very technical, I have had to review basic physics that I had not used in many years to remember the electromagnetic spectrum, the different types of wave lengths, colors, etc. It has also been a bit difficult to download data that works and then visualizing it on QGis or Rstudio, for me it is a work in progress as I learn how to be more efficient and accurate. Nonetheless, it is fascinating how\nIt is quite amazing to see how these large satellites, that I have always seen as very scientific and foreign to me, can produce images and data that is super important and useful for my “real world” applications such as conservation monitoring. Coming from Colombia, a country with unreliable and incomplete environmental and demographic data, I feel that these tools can be amazingly useful to have real-time ecological and social monitoring.\nI find it fascinating how one single tool can help in so many ways. As a person that is both interested in demographic changes and environmental conservation, remote sensing of a specific region (such as city) can be used to monitor and evaluate both things. I feel very inspired to use these tools to better diagnose the regions that I am interested in, and identify both the environmental and socioeconomic problematic that most affect the people and wildlife, and then have the ability to do measurement and evaluation in real time. I also think, that from a more superficial and communications perspective, this type of videos or images are also much more beautiful and easy to understand.\nI am excited to see how the course progresses and all that I can learn and later apply."

    "section": "4.1 What is it?",
    "text": "4.1 What is it?\nSatellite images are crucial sources of geospatial information, but they are not immune to distortions that can impact the accuracy of spatial analysis. These distortions may arise from various factors, including off-nadir view angles, variations in topography, wind effects (particularly in aerial data collection), and even the Earth’s rotation. To address these distortions and ensure the precise alignment of satellite imagery with geographic data, a process known as geometric correction is employed. Geometric correction plays a pivotal role in rectifying these distortions, making it an indispensable step in the preparation of satellite imagery for accurate spatial analysis.\nGeometric correction is a meticulous process that involves several key steps. Ground Control Points (GCPs), often established through Global Positioning System (GPS) measurements, serve as reference markers. These GCPs are used to establish a mathematical model for geometric transformation, enabling the adjustment of the image’s coordinates. Various transformation algorithms are available to model the actual coordinates accurately. The correction process encompasses both forward and backward mapping to ensure precise alignment. Additionally, the accuracy of the geometric correction is assessed using metrics such as Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). Lower RMSE values indicate a better fit of the corrected data to the reference dataset. Overall, geometric correction is fundamental in enhancing the accuracy and usability of satellite imagery for a wide range of applications, from environmental monitoring to urban planning."

Their importance cannot be overstated, as they serve as the linchpin for ensuring that remotely sensed imagery can be effectively harnessed across a multitude of applications. The process of correction not only rectifies distortions but also paves the way for the extraction of valuable information from remote sensing data. This corrected data is indispensable for critical tasks such as land cover classification, change detection, and the assessment of biophysical parameters like temperature, leaf area index, and NDVI. These correction techniques find practical applications in diverse fields, including agriculture, urban planning, environmental monitoring, and disaster management. Ultimately, they elevate the quality and utility of remote sensing products, equipping decision-makers with invaluable insights for making informed choices and driving evidence-based decisions."

    "section": "5.1 Bogota’s Green Corridor Plan - Septima Verde",
    "text": "5.1 Bogota’s Green Corridor Plan - Septima Verde\n\n5.1.1 Context of Bogota\nBogota is a city heavily criticized for its poor urban planning; it is one of the largest and densest capital cities in Latin America yet it suffers from having some of the worst public transportation systems and a lack of sustainable infrastructure (cita).\nFor many decades, Bogota was one of the most advanced and innovative cities, home to Transmilenio (xx) and at the time, the largest bicycle route in South America (xx), as well as having constructed various sustainable buildings (xx). Nonetheless, the city has grown at such a fast rate, and in such an informal way, that the urban planning has not been able to support the growing demographic necessities. (cita).\nBecause of this, it’s inhabitants are exposed to heavily contaminated air, to horrible traffic, to an expensive transportation system that does not support the population density of the city, and to great disparities regarding access to sustainable infrastructure such as as green housing, bicycle routs, etc… (cita). It is one of few cities with more than 7 million citizens that does NOT have a metro system. (cita), making it very dependent on cars. There have been many proposals for urban “retenes” and carpooling obligations, which have all been debated and blocked by congress.\n\n\n5.1.2 Septima Verde\nOne of the newest project ideas is the Septima Verde Project, which proposes to build a green corridor along one of the largest and busiest avenues in the city; this project includes building pedestrian and cycle friendly routes and the delimitation of green spaces and parks, ultimately reducing car lanes and hopefully encouraging for more non-motorized transportation. The project’s goal is also to promote more sustainable urban development plans and improve air quality.\nThis project will use the current sidewalk and 4 vehicule lanes (half of the highway) as well as various unused lots and dwellings.\n Image: The proposed Corredor Verde project.\nObjectives:\n\nTo transform certain streets and corridors into pedestrian-friendly spaces with an emphasis on greenery, parks, and public spaces.\nTo reduce car lanes and allocate more space for pedestrians, cyclists, and public transportation.\nTo encourage the use of non-motorized transportation, such as walking and cycling.\nTo combat air pollution and enhance urban sustainability by increasing green spaces and reducing car emissions.\n\nKey Components:\n\nUrban Planning: The initiative involves urban planning and redesign efforts to allocate more space for pedestrians, greenery, and public amenities.\nCycling Infrastructure: The creation of dedicated bike lanes and cycling infrastructure to promote sustainable transportation options.\nPublic Transportation Integration: Integration with public transportation systems, such as TransMilenio, to encourage the use of buses and reduce private car use.\nGreen Spaces: The inclusion of green spaces, parks, and urban gardens along the corridors to enhance the urban environment and improve air quality.\nAccessibility: Improving accessibility for people with disabilities through the creation of barrier-free spaces.\nStreet Furniture: Installation of street furniture, benches, and public art to enhance the overall experience of the corridors.\n\nWithin the project, it is also contemplated to construct new routs for Transmilenio (Bogota’s bus system) around this corridor, giving people more incentives to not use their car. This last component of the project has generated much public and political debate. The Mayoress of Bogota had made a big point, during her campaign, to not building public transportation infrastructure during this avenue, and this project would be a direct contradiction to this, the main opposers of the project are ironically her election base.\nThis makes for a very interesting political setting. The creation of the green corridor, as well as the public transportation routes, would really help some of the most deprived populations, as it would give them access to better transportation, to more green areas, and in general would hopefully decongest the traffic; but it has been made clear that it would affect negatively the richer citizens who have benefited from this highway with no public transportation and just private cars. This project has become a clear example of how difficult it is to propose and implement a public policy or a public project that keeps everyone content. Additionally, many opposers also suggest better ways to use the unused lots such as building schools or community centers.\nAdditionally, this is a hefty project budgeted at 2.5 billion COP (aprox 640 million USD).\n\n\n5.1.3 Applications of remote sensing:\nI. During the planning and design of this project:\n- Land Use Data (Sentinel-2, Landsat 8): To identify existing use patterns, distinguishing between green spaces, industrial infrastructure, housing, roads, etc. This was critical in defining the green area baseline to which to aggregate too, as well as define the businesses and residential neighborhoods that would be affected.\n- Air Quality Data (Sentinel-5p): To monitor the baseline of air pollution in the designated areas to define the benchmarks.\n- Vegetation and Land Cover Monitoring (Sentinel-2, Landsat 8): To characterize the current vegetation health status and biodiversity, and to better define what type of green areas to add.\nII. During the monitoring and compliance of the project:\n- Urban Heat Monitoring (Thermal imagery): To measure the cooling impact of the green spaces and possible reduced traffic.\n- Air Quality Assessment (Sentinel-5p): To measure improvements in air quality.\n- Traffic Analysis (Satellite traffic data): To identify changes in flows and mobility patterns, to measure traffic of pedestrian and of vehicle paths, to identify consequences over traffic in surrounding highways.\nAll of this will be complimented with robust demographic and socio economic data, to measure improvements over economy, income and mobility in the affected populations and sectors; as well as with data from traffic police or public transportation companies regarding the hopeful increase in people using public transportation and a reduction in car use.\n\n\n5.1.4 Personal reflections:\nAs a Colombian and Bogotá-raised anthropologist and geographer deeply passionate about my city’s vibrant culture and potential for sustainable development, my journey has been both inspiring and challenging. Bogotá, with its rich history and diverse communities, has always held a special place in my heart. Witnessing the city’s progress towards sustainability has been a source of hope and pride, as initiatives like “Septima Verde” have aimed to transform our urban landscape into a greener, more pedestrian-friendly haven.\nHowever, my passion is tempered by concerns and a critical perspective. The specter of corruption and inefficiency that has haunted local governments often overshadows these noble efforts. It pains me to see the misallocation of resources and missed opportunities for meaningful change. My role as an anthropologist and geographer has fueled my determination to not only celebrate our successes but also hold our leaders accountable for their actions—or lack thereof.\nNavigating the delicate balance between love for my city and the need for reform has been a constant theme in my personal and professional life. Despite the challenges, I remain dedicated to contributing to the sustainable development of Bogotá and fostering a brighter future for all its inhabitants, driven by my unwavering belief in the potential of our beautiful city.\n\n\n5.1.5 Bibliography:\n\nhttps://elpais.com/america-colombia/2023-10-26/el-corredor-verde-de-la-septima-proyecto-insignia-de-claudia-lopez-naufraga-en-un-juzgado.html\nhttps://www.portafolio.co/economia/corredor-verde-por-la-septima-se-mantiene-en-que-consiste-el-proyecto-570477\nhttps://observatorio.dadep.gov.co/noticias/plan-para-transformar-la-carrera-7ma-en-bogota\nhttps://www.lasillavacia.com/red-de-expertos/red-cachaca/repensando-el-corredor-verde-de-la-septima-estrategias-temporales-para-predios-en-espera/"
