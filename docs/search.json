    "text": "4.1 Summary\nThe subject this week was correction and different ways in which we could edit, improve and enhance images to better suit the specific analysis that we want. It was a very technical and scientific week. For this week diary entry, I will start with a quick summary of the technical definitions and processes that I learnt, and then I have decided to go into detail on the practical that we did in class in which we applied Grey Level Co-Occurence Matrix to correct the texture of an image, as well as analyse a real world case in Colombia where this methodology was also used.I finish this entry with my personal reflections.\n\n4.1.1 What is it, and why is it important?\nJust like any data recollection tool, Satellites are not always accurate and need some sort of correction or enhancements to improve the images they gather. The distortions can be caused by many things such as wrong view angles, harsh variations in topography, strong winds, or other climactic conditions such as rain or snow.\nGeometric correction is the process in which satellite imagery is corrected. Each image has reference markers, such as each coordinates, which help trace and map images from before and after. All of these images are then passed through different mathematical algorithms for correction.\nThere are many different types of correction and enhancement.I will get into further detail about Dark Object Subtraction.\n\n\n\nGeometric Correction\n\n\n\n\n4.1.2 Types of Correction\nRadiometric: Correcting the digital number to reflectance. Different uses of sensors result in different known values.\nGeometric: Deals with data distortion.Requires input to ortho-refortify using control points and DEM (Digital Elevation Model).\nAtmospheric: Corrects for atmospheric effects on sensor data. Involves local and empirical methods.\nOrthorectification: Involves forcing a view to be correct as if viewed from above.\n\n\n4.1.3 Methods for Enhancement\nAll though there are many types of enhancement that can be done to satellite imaging, I will talk about just a few:\nRatio: Rationing involves calculating the difference between two spectral bands to highlight specific landscape features. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is a common example, exploiting the spectral trait where healthy vegetation reflects more in the Near-Infrared (NIR) but absorbs in the Red wavelength. This method is useful for identifying areas with healthy vegetation.\n\n\n\nRatio Correction\n\n\nFiltering: Filtering applies moving window operations to data, which can enhance or suppress certain features. An example is the Laplacian filter, used to highlight edges or contrast in the imagery, thus aiding in feature identification and analysis.\nTexture Texture Analysis focuses on the pixel-to-pixel relationships within an image to describe surface characteristics. This technique is valuable for distinguishing between different land cover types based on their texture, such as smooth grassland or bumpy deciduous forests.\n\n\n\nTexture Correction\n\n\nJoining Data Preprocessing steps performed on collected data. Methods include enhancement, feature extraction, etc.\nFeathering When you join two matching images together. Creates a seamless image without harsh boundaries.\nMosaicking Images are pieced together to form one large image."

    "text": "4.2 In class-application of GLCM Method\nOne of the practical exercises this week, was to use the GLCM package in R Studio to correct the texture in some satellite imagery.\nThe GLCM method is used to extract statistical measures from satellite images that can help differentiate between different land cover types based on their texture, such as distinguishing forests from urban areas.\nThe GLCM package facilitates texture analysis by computing a matrix where the frequency of co-occurring pixel values at a certain spatial relationship is recorded. This matrix is then used to calculate various texture statistics that describe the heterogeneity or patterns within the image.\n\nThe size of the moving window determines how large an area each calculation considers. A window of size (7, 7) means that for each pixel, the texture is analyzed based on its 7x7 neighbors.\nThe shift parameter defines the spatial relationship between pixel pairs considered in the GLCM. It’s essentially the direction and distance between the pair of pixels.\nThe GLCM package can compute various texture measures such as homogeneity, contrast, and correlation. These measures provide quantitative data on the texture’s smoothness, variation, and spatial dependency among pixels. The choice of statistics will depend on the aspect of texture you are interested in analyzing.\n\nInterpretation of results: - Color Scale: A value closer to 1 indicates high homogeneity, meaning the texture is very uniform in that area. Values closer to 0 suggest low homogeneity, where the texture is less uniform and more varied. - Color Representation: The colors in the image correspond to the homogeneity values at each location. For example, areas colored in green might indicate regions of higher homogeneity, while yellow to pink areas might represent lower homogeneity. - Spatial Distribution: The distribution of colors across the plot shows how homogeneity varies spatially. Clusters of similar colors indicate areas with similar texture properties. For example, large green areas would be more uniform in texture, possibly open fields or water bodies, while mixed colors like yellow and pink could suggest urban or forested areas with more complex structures."

They implemented various correction methodologies as well as more advanced machine learning processes, their objective was to tackle the cloud coverage which always affects imaging in this region of the world. They were very successful in classifying land cover which is a great advance for natural resource management and climate change adaptation, one of Colombia’s environmental pillars.\nThe scientific journal mentions that within their methodologies, GLCM was used in a to enhance land cover mapping in Colombia."

These techniques make sure that the pictures and data we get from satellites will really show what’s happening on Earth.\nAs an anthropologist, working in environmental conservation and rural development, and now diving into data science, I am getting very inspired by all of this new information regarding remote sensing. Remote sensing will let me gather lots of info about our planet and using these correction techniques, it will be easier to make smart decisions for the environment and how rural areas develop.\nI really enjoyed applying the GLCM method because it provided key insights into the spatial arrangement of pixel values. This could easily be used for land cover classification, environmental monitoring, and urban planning, where understanding the texture is crucial for accurate analysis.This is something that I in-vision myself using in my personal and professional interests.\nIt was fascinating for me to read the scientific journal of scientists applying what I had applied in a practical, in a real life case of improving image quality to be able to identify and characterise land cover and vegetation."

    "section": "5.1 Summary of Bogota’s Septima Verde",
    "text": "5.1 Summary of Bogota’s Septima Verde\nOne of the newest project ideas is the Septima Verde Project, which proposes to build a green corridor along one of the largest and busiest avenues in the city; this project includes building pedestrian and cycle friendly routes and the delimitation of green spaces and parks, ultimately reducing car lanes and hopefully encouraging for more non-motorized transportation. The project’s goal is also to promote more sustainable urban development plans and improve air quality.\nThis project will use the current sidewalk and 4 vehicle lanes (half of the highway) as well as various unused lots and dwellings.\n\n\n\nSeptima Verde Project\n\n\nObjectives:\n\nTo transform certain streets and corridors into pedestrian-friendly spaces with an emphasis on greenery, parks, and public spaces.\nTo reduce car lanes and allocate more space for pedestrians, cyclists, and public transportation.\nTo encourage the use of non-motorized transportation, such as walking and cycling.\nTo combat air pollution and enhance urban sustainability by increasing green spaces and reducing car emissions.\n\nKey Components:\n\nUrban Planning: The initiative involves urban planning and redesign efforts to allocate more space for pedestrians, greenery, and public amenities.\nCycling Infrastructure: The creation of dedicated bike lanes and cycling infrastructure to promote sustainable transportation options.\nPublic Transportation Integration: Integration with public transportation systems, such as TransMilenio, to encourage the use of buses and reduce private car use.\nGreen Spaces: The inclusion of green spaces, parks, and urban gardens along the corridors to enhance the urban environment and improve air quality.\nAccessibility: Improving accessibility for people with disabilities through the creation of barrier-free spaces.\nStreet Furniture: Installation of street furniture, benches, and public art to enhance the overall experience of the corridors.\n\nIt also contemplates the construction of new routs of public bus around this corridor, giving people more incentives to not use their car. This last component of the project has generated much public and political debate.\n\n5.1.1 Context of Bogota\nBogota is a city heavily criticized for its poor urban planning; it is one of the largest and densest capital cities in Latin America yet it suffers from having some of the worst public transportation systems and a lack of sustainable infrastructure.\nFor many decades, Bogota was one of the most advanced and innovative cities, home to Transmilenio and the largest bicycle route in South America, as well as having constructed various sustainable buildings. Nonetheless, the city has grown at such a fast rate, and in such an informal way, that the urban planning has not been able to support the growing demographic necessities. - Bogotá has experienced explosive growth over the past few, leading to sprawling urban development that outpaces the city’s ability to provide infrastructure and services.It’s population grows 2% a year. - The city is notorious for its traffic jams, with residents facing long daily commutes. The lack of a metro system exacerbates this issue, making Bogotá heavily reliant on road-based transportation.On average, citizens spend 132 hours a year in traffic. - Bogotá struggles with air pollution, primarily due to vehicular emissions. This issue is compounded by the city’s geographical location in a high-altitude valley, which can trap pollutants.The current air quality is 2.3 times above WHO’s recommendation. - Bogotá struggles with air pollution, primarily due to vehicular emissions. This issue is compounded by the city’s geographical location in a high-altitude valley, which can trap pollutants.The current air quality is 2.3 times above WHO’s recommendation.\n\n\n\nPollution in Bogota\n\n\nBecause of this, it’s inhabitants are exposed to heavily contaminated air, to horrible traffic, to an expensive transportation system that does not support the population density of the city, and to great disparities regarding access to sustainable infrastructure such as as green housing, bicycle routs, etc… It is one of few cities with more than 7 million citizens that does NOT have a metro system, making it very dependent on cars. There have been many proposals for urban traffic tolls and carpooling obligations, which have all been debated and blocked by congress.\n\n\n5.1.2 Political context around the proposal\nThe Mayoress of Bogota had made a big point, during her campaign, to not building public transportation infrastructure during this avenue, and this project would be a direct contradiction to this, the main opposers of the project are ironically her election base.\nThis makes for a very interesting political setting. The creation of the green corridor, as well as the public transportation routes, would really help some of the most deprived populations, as it would give them access to better transportation, to more green areas, and in general would hopefully decongest the traffic; but it has been made clear that it would affect negatively the richer citizens who have benefited from this highway with no public transportation and just private cars.\nThis project has become a clear example of how difficult it is to propose and implement a public policy or a public project that keeps everyone content. Additionally, many opposers also suggest better ways to use the unused lots such as building schools or community centers.\n\n\n5.1.3 Link to Global Agendas/Goals:\nIncorporating remotely sensed data to tackle urban congestion and pollution aligns with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities) and SDG 13 (Climate Action). By improving air quality and reducing traffic congestion, cities can create more sustainable, livable environments for their inhabitants, contributing to global efforts against climate change and for sustainable urban development.\nThe Septima Verde proposal would advance the current approaches to urban planning and mobility by prioritizing sustainable, active mobility (walking, cycling, and the use of electric vehicles) and extensive citizen participation in the planning process. This approach signifies a shift from car-centric to people-centric urban development, promoting a cultural transformation towards sustainability and inclusivity. The project’s emphasis on green corridors, pedestrian-friendly spaces, and enhanced public transport options sets a precedent for cities globally, showcasing how integrating technology and community engagement can lead to more resilient and sustainable urban environments."

This foundational analysis is crucial for determining where green areas can be expanded and which neighborhoods or commercial areas will benefit most from the project. This strategic input ensures the project’s interventions are both beneficial and precisely targeted.\nBaseline Air Quality Monitoring with Sentinel-5p: Establishing an initial air quality benchmark is vital for setting achievable yet ambitious project goals. By monitoring baseline air pollution levels, project planners can define clear, quantifiable targets for air quality improvements, ensuring the project’s impact is both measurable and substantial.\nVegetation and Land Cover Assessment via Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8: Analyzing current vegetation health and diversity enables the project to tailor green space enhancements to the city’s specific ecological and aesthetic needs. This focus on biodiversity not only beautifies urban spaces but also contributes to the overall ecological health of the area.\nFor the Monitoring and Compliance Stage:\nMitigating Urban Heat Effects with Thermal Imagery: By incorporating thermal imagery to monitor the cooling effects of newly introduced green spaces, the project can directly measure its impact on reducing urban heat island effects. This data-driven approach allows for a quantifiable assessment of the project’s climate mitigation effectiveness.\nOngoing Air Quality Assessment with Sentinel-5p: Continuously measuring air quality post-implementation ensures that the project’s air pollution reduction goals are met or exceeded, providing tangible benefits to urban residents.\nAnalyzing Traffic Flow and Mobility Patterns with Satellite Traffic Data: Understanding changes in mobility patterns is essential for assessing the project’s success in reducing vehicular traffic and promoting sustainable transportation modes. Satellite traffic data offers a detailed view of how pedestrian and vehicular movements evolve as a result of the project, enabling adjustments and highlighting successful strategies.\nThe inclusion of real-time data on vehicular movements and air pollutants, complemented by satellite imagery for green cover and urban expansion monitoring, underpins the project’s data-driven approach. The employment of platforms like Streetmix for public engagement further democratizes the urban planning process, allowing citizens to contribute actively to the visioning and redesigning of their streets in alignment with sustainable transportation modes. This integrated methodology not only enhances decision-making through robust data analysis but also fosters a collaborative planning environment, leveraging technology to achieve urban sustainability goals."

This initiative aimed to reduce temperatures, improve air quality, and offer shaded, green spaces for public use. By contrast, Bogotá’s Septima Verde focuses on creating a sustainable mobility corridor that prioritizes pedestrians, cyclists, and non-motorized transport, along with the enhancement of green spaces. While both projects aim to improve urban sustainability and livability, Medellín’s project is more directly focused on combating heat and air pollution, whereas Bogotá’s has a broader scope related to urban mobility and space reclamation for community use.\nBoth initiatives demonstrate innovative approaches to addressing urban environmental challenges, showcasing the potential for Colombian cities to lead in sustainable urban development.

    "text": "6.1 Summary\nThis week was dedicated to Google Earth Engine (GEE), a cloud-based platform that enables planetary-scale environmental data analysis, and facilitates the processing of massive environmental datasets.\n\n\n\nGoogle Earth Engine\n\n\nGEE functions by storing environmental datasets on cloud servers and processing this data server-side based on code written by users. It handles different data types, including raster (Image) and vector (Feature) data, and supports operations like image collection manipulation, regression analysis, and machine learning. GEE’s architecture is designed around client-server interactions, with client-side code running in the user’s browser and server-side operations executed on Google’s servers.\nI always find Google, and all it’s resources and infrastructure, fascinating; I really support their contribution to the collection and storage of information and data, and their openness in making everything accessible.\nPractical implementation\nThe practical implementation of GEE involves setting up the environment, understanding GEE-specific terms, and writing JavaScript code for data analysis. Users can manipulate data through operations like filtering image collections, applying regression analysis to detect changes over time, and employing machine learning for classification tasks.\nMapping Points in Google Earth Engine: You can easily center the map on a specific location by creating a point object with geographic coordinates. Additionally, you have the option to manually add points to the map through the GUI by selecting the point icon, creating a new layer, and giving it a suitable name. This process allows for the dynamic exploration of specific areas within the GEE platform.\nWorking with Landsat Data: Landsat data can be accessed and loaded into GEE script from the data catalogue, and be filtered the Landsat 9 data for a specific time frame. Further filtering options can refine the dataset based on time, region of interest, and cloud cover to ensure the data’s relevance and quality.\nEnhancing Image Quality: Applying scale factors and offsets is crucial for accurate representation. Implementing a function to apply these scale factors can significantly improve the quality of the images for analysis.\nCreating Mosaics and Clipping Images: Mosaicing and clipping are essential techniques for managing differences between tiles and focusing analysis on specific regions.\nAdvanced Analysis and Exporting: Further analysis techniques such as texture measures, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and calculating indices like NDVI are available in GEE for deeper insights into the data.\nMachine Learning: ML algorithms can be applied to perform tasks such as classification, regression, and clustering directly within the cloud-based platform."

Due to challenges with predefined algorithms that targeted land areas causing artifacts in open water bodies, a custom water mask was developed to enhance the mosaic’s accuracy.\nAlgorithm Implementation and Mosaic Process: - A cloud-masking function was developed to assign a cloud score to each pixel, utilizing several criteria to differentiate clouds from other features like snow.\n\n\n\nGEE Imaging of Zurich\n\n\n\nQuality bands such as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index - NDVI, were added to the images to select the pixel with the highest quality value for the mosaic.\nThe mosaic algorithm was designed to operate seasonally across different years, improving the representation of Switzerland’s diverse landscapes throughout the seasons. Different quality bands were used for land and water areas to ensure a homogeneous appearance across the mosaic.\n\nThrough the application of quality bands and a cloud-masking function, the project succeeded in creating a visually consistent and cloud-free representation of Switzerland. This was particularly evident in the handling of water bodies and areas with snow coverage, where specialized criteria were applied to maintain clarity and accuracy.\nThe study generated seasonal mosaics (winter, spring, summer, autumn) that were then combined to form a comprehensive view of Switzerland.

    "text": "7.1 Summary\nThis week we learnt about classification techniques in remote sensing, essential for analyzing and monitoring phenomena like urban expansion, air pollution, and changes in land use and cover. These techniques, including machine learning and traditional methods, play a pivotal role in environmental management and urban planning.\nWe covered a range of supervised machine learning tools – from simple linear regression to CART and Regression Trees.\n\n7.1.1 Applications of Classification in Remote Sensing\n\nUrban Expansion: Tracking changes in urban areas using Landsat imagery.\nAir Pollution: Monitoring pollution levels through satellite data.\nLand Use and Land Cover Changes: Identifying changes over time to inform conservation and development strategies.\nForest Dynamics: Detecting illegal logging and forest degradation.\n\nMachine Learning: Both machine learning and traditional classification methods are employed in remote sensing. Machine learning approaches, such as supervised and unsupervised learning, offer powerful tools for handling complex datasets, while traditional methods provide foundational techniques for image classification.\nCART: CART classifies or predicts outcomes by splitting the dataset into subsets through decision forks based on predictor variables. It aims to minimize variance within subsets for continuous data (via mean square error) and reduce impurity for categorical data (via Gini impurity). The process stops when it meets a predefined criterion to avoid overfitting (where the model fits the training data too closely) or underfitting (where the model is too simplistic).\nRandom Forest: Random Forest improves upon the decision tree method by creating an ensemble of trees, each derived from a subset of the training data. It combines the outcomes of these trees to make a final prediction, enhancing reliability and accuracy by overcoming biases and variances of individual trees.\nImage Classification: It is the process where images are categorised into one or more classes based on their content. There are two method types for this, supervised (selecting training samples, training the classifier, applying it to classify whole dataset) and unsupervised (Algorithms automatically segment input data into clusters based on inherent patterns/data similarities)."

    "text": "7.2 Application of Random Forest\nI found a study, “Estimating mangrove aboveground biomass in the Colombian Pacific coast: A multisensor and machine learning approach,” done by John Josephraj Selvaraj and Bryan Ernesto Gallego Pérez, that utilizes a novel approach combining multisensor remote sensing data with machine learning techniques on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform to estimate the aboveground biomass (AGB) of mangroves on Colombia’s Pacific coast.\nEmploying Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data from ALOS-2/PALSAR-2, SRTM, NASADEM, ALOSDSM, and optical data from Landsat 8 for 2022, the research evaluated various models to quantify mangrove AGB across four departments. The focus on the Random Forest model is significant due to its superior performance in predicting AGB with an R^2 of 0.783, RMSE of 38.239 Mg/ha, and MAE of 27.409 Mg/ha, outperforming other parametric and non-parametric models. This model’s effectiveness highlights its ability to manage complex, nonlinear relationships between multisensor remote sensing data and mangrove AGB, providing a highly accurate and reliable method for estimating mangrove biomass.\nThe study’s methodology involved preprocessing of satellite data, model evaluation, and comparison, with a particular emphasis on the Random Forest algorithm for its exceptional accuracy. The generation of an AGB map, indicating mean biomass values across various classes, demonstrates the significant variability in biomass and the model’s capability to capture these differences.This approach contributes valuable insights for the management and conservation of mangrove ecosystems, vital for climate change mitigation and the protection of biodiversity and local livelihoods.\n\n\n\nRandom Forest in GEE"

    "text": "7.3 Personal reflection\nOne of the first things that excites me about this Week’s content is being able to connect methodologies from other classes such as regressions and prediction models (Random Forest for example) which I have used for social data science analysis. Learning that these methodologies can also be used for analyzing image data is fascinating and calms be down a bit, knowing that the methodologies are not that much different. That all though this has a robust physics background that I do not have, at the end of the day it is data that I can organize and understand.\nThe limitation that I find, as with any statistics and data analysis, is the potential bias or manipulation that could happen with a trained model and its supervision. Specifically if this is going to then be used to define public policy or governmental conservation efforts, it is important to limit the bais or at least control for it.\nThe second thing that excited me was the application example that I found, not only because it is in Colombia, but specifically in the Pacific region’s mangrove which is one the most vulnerable and important ecosystems we have. I have worked with this ecosystem many years, regarding sustainable agriculture and fishing, as well as incorporating it into sustainable tourism. Now, being able to study about it but from a sensor perspective just inspires me to do these types of analysis even more.\nIt also reinforced my interest and need to advocate for the conservation of these types of ecosystems, because of the importance they have on food security, global warming reduction, biodiversity, carbon reduction, etc. Being able to monitor it, in such a detailed manner, is extremely important to actually measure its reduction, and be able to mitigate its potential risks."

    "text": "8.1 Summary\nFor this week, we went deeper into classification in remote sensing, addressing big questions such as accuracy assessment, and exploring new classification approaches like OBIA and sub-pixel analysis. Since the topics where so scientific and dense, I will start the diary with some theoretical explanations before diving into the application and personal reflection.\n\n8.1.1 Advanced Classification Concepts\nSub-pixel Analysis: This technique focuses on the intricate details within each pixel to determine land cover types. By comparing the reflectance values of a pixel to the ‘ideal’ values for each land cover class, it infers the dominant land cover based on probability. In instances where a singular pixel may be composed of various different land cover types, sub-pixel analysis can be used to support classification efforts. This technique is used to estimate the fraction of each pixel that is covered by different materials/land cover types.\nObject-based Image Analysis (OBIA): OBIA takes a holistic approach, clustering similar pixels into ‘super pixels’ to analyze land cover. It is used to identify natural and urban areas. You divide the image into meaningful objects instead of using traditional pixels, and through Linear Iterative Clustering you calculate the distance from other neighboring pixels.\n\nAccuracy Assessment: A critical component of the classification process, ensuring that the results are reliable and applicable for decision-making. Accuracy is key in evaluating these models, with common measures including user’s accuracy (precision), producer’s accuracy (recall), and the F1 score, all derived from a confusion matrix. These metrics help quantify the reliability and representation of the classification results."

Facing the challenge of accurately acquiring large-scale, long-term data across the bi-national basin of Russia and Mongolia, the researchers combine local deep learning training with GEE’s cloud-based computing to imbue the platform with the necessary computational power for deep learning tasks. By selecting features sensitive to water bodies, such as visible light, near infrared, and the Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI), along with quality assessment (QA) bands to refine training labels, the methodology enables rapid access to highly accurate spatio temporal water body distribution data.\n\n\n\nLake Baikal Basin\n\n\nThe study successfully extracted water bodies for nine yearly periods between 2013 and 2021, validating the model’s high accuracy (over 92%) and demonstrating its potential for continuous monitoring and assessment of water dynamics. This work not only showcases the integration of deep learning models with GEE for environmental monitoring but also addresses the limitations of GEE in supporting deep learning computations directly. By offering a solution that rapidly automates the deployment of deep learning models for large-scale environmental analysis, this research provides valuable methodological support for understanding water resources and their temporal variability, crucial for climate change studies, disaster prevention, and sustainable management of water ecosystems.\n\n\n\nMachine Learning Mosaic\n\n\n\n\n\nMachine Learning Enhancement"

Monitoring water resources, and there are many in Colombia, has always been a challenge because of the difficult topography and varying weather and climate conditions, but the use of ML could facilitate similar processes.\nIt also inspired me to see how technology, even in geography and environmental studies, is rapidly evolving and the need for all researchers (at any level) to me committed to change, improve and evolve."

    "title": "9  Temperature and Urban Heat Islands",
    "section": "9.1 Summary",
    "text": "9.1 Summary\nThis week we talked about the critical issue in urban development that is Urban Heat Islands (UHIs) and the interplay between urban temperature dynamics and public policy. UHIs result in higher urban temperatures compared to surrounding areas, posing significant challenges to urban living and environmental sustainability.\nA quick example of an Urban Heat Island is New York City, a heavily built-up area with much higher temperatures to its surrounding rural areas. According to the United State’s Environmental Protection Agency, NYC’s annual temperature is up to 3 Celsius degrees warmer than it’s surrounding areas.\n\n\n\nUrban Heat Island effect in New York City\n\n\nUrban areas experience elevated temperatures due to factors such as heat-retaining surfaces (concrete and paved roads), industrial activities, scarce green spaces, and pollutants. This phenomenon exacerbates heat waves, impacts human health, and increases energy demand for cooling. This becomes into a vicious never-ending cycle.\nThis is becoming not only a dangerous phenomenon but also expensive, as cities are investing more and more on greener energies, in more green areas, in changing economic and social behaviors, and in general being more heat and energy efficient.\nRemote sensing technologies, particularly satellite imagery, play a crucial role in addressing urban heat island (UHI) effects. Satellites like Landsat are at the forefront of monitoring these temperature disparities, offering critical insights into urban climate dynamics.They provide comprehensive data on land cover and land use changes over time, enabling the identification of areas contributing most significantly to UHI effects.\nThis capability is essential for urban planners and environmental scientists looking to pinpoint specific urban sectors that may require green infrastructure interventions, such as increased vegetation or reflective materials, to mitigate heat absorption.\nMODIS sensoring, on the other hand, stands out due to its high temporal resolution, capturing 1-2 images daily for almost any location on the globe. This frequent data collection is invaluable for tracking temperature variations over short intervals, allowing for near-real-time monitoring of UHI effects and the effectiveness of mitigation strategies implemented to combat them. The ability of MODIS to provide daily temperature data supports efforts to understand how urban heat fluctuates with changing weather patterns, urban development, and seasonal changes, providing a dynamic view of the urban climate.\nTogether, the detailed land cover data from Landsat and the high-frequency temperature data from MODIS offer a comprehensive toolkit for detecting, understanding, and monitoring UHI effects.\n\n9.1.1 Policies\nTo combat UHIs effectively, policies must encompass a broad spectrum of urban planning and design strategies. This involves the integration of green infrastructure, such as parks, green roofs, and urban forests, which can provide shade and reduce surface temperatures through evapotranspiration. Reflective materials for buildings and pavements can deflect sunlight and decrease heat absorption. Enhancing urban ventilation can also play a significant role in reducing UHIs, facilitating the natural cooling of urban areas.\nAdditionally, policies should encourage the use of sustainable transportation options to reduce heat-generating traffic congestion. The development of compact, mixed-use communities can decrease the need for vehicular travel, thus reducing the heat emitted by vehicles. Urban planning policies that prioritize pedestrian-friendly and shaded pathways encourage walking and biking, further reducing the urban heat footprint.\nAddressing UHIs requires comprehensive policy strategies, including the promotion of green infrastructure, reflective building materials, and enhanced urban planning to increase ventilation and shade. These measures can mitigate the effects of UHIs, improving urban resilience and sustainability.\nPolicies can range from local and regional urbanistic projects or urban planning, as well as national and international agendas and commitments such as the Sustainable Development Goals.\n\n\n9.1.2 Local Policy - Medellin’s Corredor Verde\nMedellín’s approach to combating urban heat and improving environmental quality through its innovative Green Corridors project offers a compelling model for cities worldwide grappling with the challenges of urbanization and climate change. Here’s a breakdown of the project’s aspects:\nProblem: Rising temperatures and poor air quality, exacerbated by the urban heat island effect and significant increases in private transport, have become pressing issues for Medellín. The city’s geographical position in the Aburrá Valley further complicates these challenges by trapping pollution within its boundaries, with conditions unfavorable for the dispersion of pollutants.\nProposal: In response, the city initiated the Green Corridors project in 2016, aiming to mitigate heat and improve air quality through the extensive planting of over 30 corridors with 120,000 plants and 12,500 trees initially, expanding to 2.5 million smaller plants and 880,000 trees by 2021. This initiative sought to transform urban spaces by integrating greenery into road verges, vertical gardens, and along waterways, effectively connecting the city’s green spaces.\nMethodology: The project was strategically planned and implemented to enhance green coverage in areas lacking it, with a focus on major roads and waterways. An investment of $16.3 million was initially made, with ongoing maintenance costs. The selection of plant species, including highly pollution-absorbent ones like the mango tree (Mangifera indica), was critical to the project’s goals of cooling the city and improving air quality.\nResults: The implementation of green corridors has led to a noticeable 2°C reduction in temperature across the city, alongside potential improvements in air quality and biodiversity. Early studies and observations suggest the project has been effective in absorbing pollutants and reducing CO2 emissions, though comprehensive data on pollution reduction is still forthcoming.\n\n\n\nCorredor Verde in Medellin\n\n\nConclusions: Medellín’s Green Corridors project exemplifies how nature-based solutions can address urban environmental challenges, offering a replicable model for other cities. Its success highlights the importance of community support, innovative planning, and the integration of green spaces in urban design to create climate-resilient and sustainable cities. The project’s popularity and effectiveness have inspired other Colombian cities and regions like São Paulo to adopt similar initiatives, underlining the potential of green corridors as a global urban strategy against the impacts of climate change."

    "text": "9.2 Application - Class practical\nMethodology: To assess the land surface temperatures (LST) in Los Angeles, we utilized the Google Earth Engine platform and processed Landsat 8 Collection 2 Level 2 data. The Landsat images were filtered for a summer period from June to August 2022, focusing on days with less than 10% cloud cover to ensure clear-sky conditions. A custom script was applied to convert the raw thermal band (ST_B10) data into Celsius using the appropriate scale factors (0.00341802 and -273.15 for conversion to Celsius). We then masked out non-physical temperature values (less than 0 Celsius) and calculated the mean temperature across the filtered image collection to generate a single temperature map. This mean temperature map was clipped to the geographic boundaries of Los Angeles, defined by a specified set of coordinates, and visualized using a color palette ranging from cool (blue) to warm (red) temperatures.\nThe MODIS data from both the Aqua and Terra satellites were processed to provide a comprehensive analysis of the land surface temperatures over Los Angeles. After loading the respective image collections, we applied a scale factor of 0.02 and converted the LST from Kelvin to Celsius. Subsequently, the datasets from both satellites were merged to calculate the mean temperature, ensuring a robust dataset by combining morning and afternoon observations. The resulting mean temperature data was clipped to the Los Angeles region and visualized on the map with a color gradient representing the temperature range. Additionally, a time series chart was generated to illustrate the LST variation over the selected summer period.\n[]\nInterpretations: The resulting temperature map of Los Angeles reveals spatial variations in land surface temperatures during the summer period. Warmer temperatures, depicted in red, are prominent in urbanized and densely built-up areas, suggesting an urban heat island effect where human-made surfaces absorb and re-radiate heat more than natural landscapes. Cooler areas, shown in blue, typically correspond to vegetated regions, water bodies, and higher elevations that are known to influence local climate conditions. The minimum and maximum temperatures extracted from the data indicate a range of observed temperatures and help in identifying the extent of temperature variation across different land cover types. These insights can inform urban planning initiatives aimed at mitigating heat-related risks and enhancing the city’s climate resilience.\nThe MODIS LST map reveals the thermal landscape of Los Angeles, with urban areas distinctly warmer due to the urban heat island effect, as well as cooler regions corresponding to vegetated and coastal areas. The time series chart showcases the daily temperature fluctuations, providing insight into the dynamic nature of urban temperatures. These temperature patterns are crucial for urban planners and public health officials as they implement strategies to mitigate extreme heat and enhance urban livability. The ability to visualize and analyze temperature variations over time is a powerful tool in understanding and responding to the impacts of climate variability and urbanization."

    "text": "2.1 Summary\nThis week was very introductory, ideal for people like me who have no previous knowledge of remote sensing and of what satellites actually do. We learnt the basic definition of what remote sensing is, then went through some theoretical explanations on the type of sensors used, as well as the different resolutions that have to be considered and manipulated (accordingly) to get the most optimal results.\n\n2.1.1 What is it?\nRemote sensing, as defined by NASA, involves acquiring information from a distance, utilizing a variety of sensors on platforms like satellites, planes, and drones. Over 150 satellites and more than 27,000 devices in orbit provide a rich array of data sources such as Sentinel, LANDSAT, and SAR satellites, facilitating diverse applications from environmental monitoring to urban planning.\n[]\n\n\n2.1.2 Types of Sensors\nPassive sensors read solar light that is reflected off the earth’s surface; they do not emit any additional energy. A limitation is that the light can be interrupted or disturbed by clouds, contamination or any other physical obstacle.\nActive sensors send signals down to the earth that bounces back to the sensor; this makes them much more effective towards climate and atmospheric conditions.\nThere are different types of radiation, due to different materials and objects that reflect energy and light differently.The variance in radiation have different wavelengths within the electromagnetic spectrum. There is a need for different sensors to read different wavelengths and analyse different information.\n\n\n2.1.3 Types of Resolution\nRemote sensing has four resolutions:\nSpectral: The number of bands that the sensor records. Visible light is made up of red, green and blue light (R,G,B).\nSpatial: The size of each pixel in the image (very high resolution is in cm while high resolution can go up to various kms).\nTemporal: The frequency in which an area is revisited to capture more images to compare (various times a day, months appart, or years appart).\nRadiometric: The range of reflectance values that the sensor recognizes.\nThere is a constant compensation between different resolutions to find a balance to get optimal data as needed. In the next section, you can see two different examples.\nIn this week’s diary entry I will show two real life examples that use different types of resolutions to solve different environmental and demographic issues. I end the chapter with my final reflection."

    "text": "2.2 Applications\nThe significance of remote sensing extends across various fields. It’s instrumental in environmental monitoring, aiding in climate change research, deforestation tracking, and oceanography. Urban planning benefits from detailed land use and development data, while disaster response initiatives rely on immediate data for efficient management and recovery efforts.\nHigh Spatial Resolution, Low Temporal Resolution Archaeological Site Discovery: This application benefits significantly from high spatial resolution because it allows for the detailed observation of surface features that might indicate the presence of archaeological remains, such as ancient structures, roads, or tools, even if they are buried under vegetation or soil. The subtle differences in soil color, vegetation health, or topography that hint at archaeological features are more discernible with finer spatial detail. Since these sites and features do not change rapidly over time, low temporal resolution is acceptable. For example, capturing images of a potential archaeological site once a year or even less frequently might be sufficient because the changes of interest happen over decades or centuries, not days or weeks.\n\n\n\nArchaeology Site in Peru\n\n\nLow Spatial Resolution, High Temporal Resolution Weather Forecasting: For weather forecasting, high temporal resolution is crucial because weather conditions can change rapidly, and frequent updates are necessary to provide accurate forecasts. Meteorologists rely on data collected at intervals ranging from minutes to hours to track the development and movement of weather systems, such as storms, fronts, and precipitation patterns. However, the spatial resolution can be lower because the phenomena of interest, such as temperature gradients and large-scale atmospheric pressure changes, occur over large areas. Thus, capturing the broad patterns rather than the fine details is sufficient for effective forecasting.\n\n\n\nWeather Forecast\n\n\n##Reflection\nPersonally, everything I learnt this week was completely new to me. I did not know about the different types of sensors, nor was I clear on all the physics behind their image recollection. I know understand the huge value that they have on various types of measurements and studies (both urban and rural, which I find fascinating). I always though of this type of data recollection and analysis very foreign to me, but now I understand that in the fields and professions that I am interested in, I could easily incorporate satellite data.\nDoing the practical exercise, working with the raster data, processing it and then visualizing it, was very useful for me to understand the physics behind it all; seeing how all images that we see in real life are a composition of different color layers and a lot of different data.\nI also learnt a lot from the two real life applications that I investigated. First, it was fascinating to see the different fields that they apply, both very relevant and interesting to me as an anthropologist. What I learnt the most though, was how in each case, time and space have different importance and require different levels of detail. I see that each field incorporates the same methodologies but with vastly different focuses and details."
